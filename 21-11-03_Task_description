#overall task
Create a module/function in flutter for an API call to OSM Notes (= send some information on the environment from the App itself to the OSM Notes API. It will create a Note that volunteers from OSM can then work on)

#UI
Use a basic App menu with a bottom navigation bar;
when someone clicks on one of the buttons, a pop up window appears where you can describe the situation in the environment
-> paper Prototype available (see repo)
-> a simple App environment is enough for now, it will be implemented in the app later on

#API
-> When you use OSM Notes everything you send to the API will be publicly available!
-> Find a test environment for API calls in the development itself
-> For implementation with the OSM Notes API, a list of coordinates and issues for Chemnitz will be created
